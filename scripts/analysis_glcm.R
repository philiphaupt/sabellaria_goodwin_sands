# After processing, we can analyse texture like this.

library(glcm)

library(Rcpp)

# Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (Haralick et al. 1973) texture is a powerful image feature for image analysis. The glcm package provides a easy-to-use function to calculate such texutral features for RasterLayer objects in R.

# Calculation rotation-invariant texture features
# 
# The textural features can also be calculated in all 4 directions (0째, 45째, 90째 and 135째) and then combined to one rotation-invariant texture. The key for this is the shift parameter:
#   
rglcm1 <- glcm(r, 
               window = c(9,9), 
               shift=list(c(0,1), c(1,1), c(1,0), c(1,-1)), 
               statistics = c("mean", "variance", "homogeneity", "contrast", 
                              "dissimilarity", "entropy", "second_moment")
